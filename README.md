## About
This application is a drag & drop form builder built in React and bundled with Webpack. It allows you to create multi-step forms by adding containers, with each container representing a new step. The elements within the containers are displayed on the UI based on the current step the user is in.

Key features of the app include:

- Create a new Template
- Add Elements to templates by Dragging & Dropping elements to the form area.
- Sort Elements inside containers by Dragging & Dropping.
- Click Containers/Elements to edit their properties.
- Save & Publish changes
- Preview Changes on how it will look on a mobile phone.

With these capabilities, the drag & drop form builder empowers you to easily create, customize, save, publish, and preview multi-step forms, streamlining the form-building process for your application or website.
